# GenerativeAI-Powered Image Description App

## Objective:
### The primary goal of this application is to generate descriptive text for uploaded images using Google Generative AI (Gemini model). Users can input a prompt and upload an image, and the AI model will return a detailed description of the image based on the input. This tool aims to streamline the process of understanding and describing images, making it useful for accessibility, content creation, and other domains.

## Workflow:
### 1. Load Environment Variables: The application begins by loading environment variables using dotenv, which includes the Google API key to access the Gemini model.
### 2. User Input and Image Upload: Users provide a text prompt (optional) and upload an image in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png format. The image is displayed in the app once uploaded.
### 3. Interaction with Gemini Model: The get_gemini_response() function processes the prompt and image using the Google Generative AI model (Gemini 1.5 Flash). Based on the input and image, the model generates a detailed response describing the image.
### 4. Output: Once the user clicks the "Get Image Description" button, the application displays the AI-generated description of the uploaded image.
